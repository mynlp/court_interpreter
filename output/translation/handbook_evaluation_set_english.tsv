handbook-299	所論は、要するに、被告人には、本件輸入に係る物品が覚せい剤であるとの認識がなかったのであるから、被告人にその認識があったとして覚せい剤輸入の罪の成立を認めた原判決には、判決に影響を及ぼすことが明らかな事実の誤認があるというのである。	The argument, in short, is that the defendant did not have the recognition that the goods related to this import were stimulants, and therefore, the original judgment that acknowledged the crime of stimulant import recognizing that the defendant had such awareness contains an obvious factual error affecting the judgment.	The argument is that, in short, since the accused was not aware that the goods involved in the import in this case were methamphetamine, there is a clear misunderstanding of the facts in the original judgment that the defendant was found guilty of importing methamphetamine on the basis of such knowledge.	The essence of the Statement of Reasons for Appeal is as follows: The judgment in prior instance found the defendant guilty of the import of a stimulant drug. It found that he/she had the knowledge that the material imported in this case was a stimulant drug. However, since he/she did not have such knowledge, the judgment has an error in its fact finding which apparently affected the judgment. 	The purport of this appeal is as stated in the appeal statement prepared by defense counsel A and submitted by public prosecutor B, and the argument in response to this is as stated in the response document prepared by public prosecutor B and prepared by defense counsel A, so these are cited.	{'A': 'translation_gpt', 'B': 'translation_azure', 'C': 'target', 'D': 'translation_llama'}
handbook-300	しかし、原判決挙示の各証拠によると、被告人は、本件に至るまで、貨物船○○の船員として約20回日本国と○○国との間を往復している者である上、○○国において船員としての教育を受けるに当たり、覚せい罪等の密輸が禁止されていることや関税関係法規等についての知識を得ていることが認められるから、覚せい剤が概ねどのような物品であるかを承知していたと推認されるところである。	However, from the pieces of evidence listed in the judgment in prior instance, this court finds that the defendant, as a mariner on the freighter __, had sailed between Country ______ and Japan some 20 times and that while receiving education as a mariner in the same country, he/she obtained knowledge about prohibition against smuggling of stimulant drugs and other knowledge of customs-related laws. Therefore, it is assumed that he/she knew what kind of substance a stimulant drug was. 	The argument is, in short, that the defendant did not have the recognition that the items imported in this case were stimulants, and therefore, the original judgment that acknowledged the establishment of the crime of importing stimulants on the grounds that the defendant had such recognition contains a misapprehension of a factual matter that clearly affects the judgment.	However, according to each piece of evidence presented in the original judgment, the defendant is a person who has traveled approximately 20 times between Japan and ○○ as a crew member of the cargo ship ○○, and it is recognized that he has acquired knowledge about the prohibition of smuggling stimulant drugs and related customs laws during his education as a crew member in ○○, so it can be inferred that he was generally aware of what kind of goods stimulant drugs are.	However, according to the evidence presented in the original judgment, the defendant had traveled back and forth between Japan and XX countries about 20 times as a seafarer on the cargo ship XX up to this case, and it is recognized that he had acquired knowledge of the prohibition of smuggling such as stimulant crimes and customs laws and regulations in receiving education as a seafarer in XX country. It is presumed that he was generally aware of what kind of goods methamphetamine was.	{'A': 'target', 'B': 'translation_llama', 'C': 'translation_gpt', 'D': 'translation_azure'}
handbook-301	そして、このことを前提として、甲から本件物品の運搬を依頼された際の物品の運搬ないし引渡しの方法についての指示内容が極めて密行性を帯びたものであったこと、被告人は本件物品がビニール製5袋に分けられた白色の結晶状を呈した物質であることを確認していること、搬入の手段、方法が覚せい剤等を持ち込む際によく行われる典型的な隠匿運搬方法を採っていること、その他本件発覚前後の証拠隠滅工作、被告人の捜査官に対する供述の内容等記録によって認められる諸事情をも考え合わせると、本件物品が覚せい剤であるとは知らなかったという被告人の弁解は到底信用できるものではなく、本件輸入の際、被告人は本件物品が覚せい剤であるとの認識を有していたと認めるのが相当である。	However, according to each piece of evidence presented in the original judgment, the defendant had made approximately 20 round trips between Japan and the country of OO as a crew member of the cargo ship OO before this incident, and it is recognized that the defendant had acquired knowledge about the prohibition of smuggling, including stimulant-related crimes, and customs-related regulations when receiving education as a crew member in the country of OO, so it can be inferred that the defendant was aware of what kind of item stimulants are in general.	Based on this assumption, the defendant's explanation that he/she did not know that the substance in question was a stimulant drug is not reliable at all in light of the following: First, at the time that the defendant was requested by A to carry the material in question, the directions given as to how to transport and deliver it had all the indications of secrecy. Second, the defendant found that the material in question was a white crystalline substance divided into five (5) vinyl bags. Third, the manner in which the material was carried into Japan is a typical undercover method common to transporting stimulant drugs and other drugs. Fourth, there are additional factors shown in the record such as attempts by the defendant to destroy the evidence before and after this case came to light and the statements given by the defendant to investigators. Therefore, it is appropriate to find that the defendant had knowledge at the time of the import in question that the substance in question was a stimulant drug. 	Based on this premise, the defendant confirmed that the instructions on how to transport or deliver the goods when requested by the First Party were extremely confidential, that the accused confirmed that the goods were a white crystalline substance divided into five plastic bags, and that the means of delivery, Considering the fact that the method adopted the typical concealment and transportation method that is often used when bringing in methamphetamine, etc., and other circumstances recognized by the record, such as the destruction of evidence before and after the discovery of this case, and the contents of the accused's statement to the investigating officer, the defendant's excuse that he did not know that the goods in question were methamphetamine is not credible at all. It is reasonable to admit that the accused was aware that the article in question was a methamphetamine.	And given this, considering the highly secretive nature of the instructions regarding the method of transportation or delivery of the goods at the time of the request from Party A, the fact that the defendant confirmed the items to be a white crystalline substance divided into five vinyl bags, that the means and methods of transportation employed a typical concealment method often used for smuggling stimulants, and various circumstances acknowledged in the records such as evidence destruction activities before and after the incident's discovery and the defendant's statements to investigators, the defendant's excuse that they did not know the items were stimulants is hardly credible, and it is reasonable to conclude that the defendant was aware that the items were stimulants at the time of import.	{'A': 'translation_llama', 'B': 'target', 'C': 'translation_azure', 'D': 'translation_gpt'}
handbook-302	したがって、原判決がその挙示する各証拠を総合して原判示事実を認定したことは相当であり、原判決に事実誤認はないから、論旨は理由がない。	And, assuming this, the instruction contents regarding the method of carrying or delivering the goods when defendant A was instructed to transport the goods in this case were extremely confidential, the defendant confirmed that the goods in this case were a white crystalline substance divided into 5 vinyl bags, the means and method of introduction were typical of the hidden transport method often used when bringing in stimulants, and considering other circumstances such as evidence destruction work before and after the discovery of this case and the content of the defendant's statement to the investigator as recorded, the defendant's excuse that they did not know the goods in this case were stimulants is not credible at all, and it is reasonable to conclude that at the time of importing the goods in this case, the defendant recognized that the goods in this case were stimulants.	Therefore, this court finds that it was proper that the judgment in prior instance found the facts as cited therein based on the pieces of evidence as listed therein, and that there is no error in fact finding. Thus, there is no ground for appeal. 	Therefore, it is reasonable that the original judgment established the facts as indicated by comprehensively considering each piece of evidence presented, and there is no factual error in the original judgment, so the argument is groundless.	Therefore, it is reasonable that the original judgment found the facts of the original trial by combining each of the evidences presented, and since there is no factual error in the original judgment, the argument is without merit.	{'A': 'translation_llama', 'B': 'target', 'C': 'translation_gpt', 'D': 'translation_azure'}
handbook-303	所論は、要するに、被告人を禁錮1年6月に処した原判決の量刑は重すぎて不当であるというのである。	The argument presented in this appeal in brief claims that the sentence given by the court of prior instance, one year and six months imprisonment without work, is improper in its severity. 	The argument is, in short, that the sentence of imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months imposed by the original judgment on the defendant is too severe and therefore unjust.	The argument is, in short, that the sentencing of the original judgment that sentenced the defendant to one year and six months in prison was too heavy and unjust.	Therefore, it is reasonable that the original judgment determined the facts shown in the original judgment by synthesizing each of the cited evidence, and since there is no factual error in the original judgment, the argument is without grounds.	{'A': 'target', 'B': 'translation_gpt', 'C': 'translation_azure', 'D': 'translation_llama'}
handbook-304	記録によれば、本件事故は、被告人が前車の発進に気を許し左方の安全を確認することなく発進進行した過失により、折から横断歩道上を自転車に乗って進行していた被害者に自車を衝突転倒させ死亡させたというものであって、過失及び結果の重大性にかんがみると、所論指摘の被告人に有利な事情を十分考慮しても、原判決の量刑は、その宣告時においては相当であったと認めることができる。	The argument is, in short, that the sentence of the original judgment, which sentenced the defendant to imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months, is too severe and unfair.	According to the record, the accident in this case was as follows: the defendant, while driving an automobile, hit, knocked down and caused the death of the victim who was riding a bicycle in a crosswalk, due to the defendant' s negligence in that he/she started his/her automobile and proceeded just following the start of the preceding vehicle, without confirming safety on the left. Reflecting upon the seriousness of both the negligence and the result of the accident, and even duly considering the circumstances that have been presented in favor of the defendant, sentencing of the judgment in prior instance as handed down at the time should be recognized as proper.	According to the record, this accident occurred due to the defendant's negligence in proceeding without ensuring safety to the left, assuming the vehicle ahead had started, resulting in a collision with and causing the death of the victim who was riding a bicycle on the crosswalk, and considering the negligence and the severity of the result, even after fully taking into account the circumstances favorable to the defendant as pointed out in the argument, the original sentence can be deemed appropriate at the time of pronouncement.	According to the record, the accident in this case was caused by the defendant's negligence in starting the car in front of him without checking the safety of the left side, causing the victim who was riding a bicycle on the pedestrian crossing to collide with his car and cause him to die. It can be admitted that it was reasonable at the time of the sentence.	{'A': 'translation_llama', 'B': 'target', 'C': 'translation_gpt', 'D': 'translation_azure'}
handbook-305	しかし、当審事実取調べの結果によれば、原判決後、被害者の遺族との間に、さらに任意保険等から....合計2000万円を支払うことで示談が成立していること、示談の成立に伴い被害感情は一層和らぎ、被害者の遺族から寛大な処分を望む旨の上申がなされるに至っていることなどの事情が認められ、これによれば、原判決の量刑は、現時点においては刑の執行を猶予しなかった点において重きに失し、これを破棄しなければ明らかに正義に反するといわなければならない。	According to the records, this accident was caused by the defendant's negligence in starting to proceed without checking the safety on the left side, being caught up in the departure of the preceding vehicle, and thereby colliding with and knocking down the victim who was proceeding on a bicycle on the crosswalk, resulting in the victim's death, and in light of the negligence and the severity of the consequences, even if the points of argument pointing out the favorable circumstances for the defendant are fully taken into consideration, the sentencing of the original judgment can be recognized as being reasonable at the time of its pronouncement.	However, according to the results of the examination of the facts by this court, the court finds that after the judgment in prior instance, a settlement was made between the victim's family and the side of the defendant and the insurance, etc. to pay a total of 20 million yen, and as the feelings of the victim's family concerning the accident were mitigated by the settlement, the victim's family hoped in writing that the court grant leniency. In recognition of these circumstances, the sentencing of the judgment in prior instance should be considered too severe, at the present time, on the point that the judgment in prior instance did not grant suspension of the execution of the sentence. It would be clearly unjust if this court did not order a reversal on that point. 	However, according to the results of the factual inquiry in this court, a settlement has been reached after the original judgment with the victim's bereaved family to pay a total of 20 million yen, including voluntary insurance, and accompanying the settlement, the victim's family's feelings of harm have further softened, and they have submitted a petition desiring lenient treatment; these circumstances being recognized, it must be said that the sentencing of the original judgment is overly severe for not having suspended the execution of the sentence at this point in time, and it must be stated that not overturning it would be clearly contrary to justice.	However, according to the results of the investigation into the facts of this trial, after the original judgment, there was a dispute with the victim's family and from voluntary insurance. Based on the fact that a settlement was reached by paying a total of 20 million yen, and that the victim's feelings were further alleviated by the conclusion of the settlement, and that the victim's family had made an appeal for leniency, the sentencing of the original judgment was weighted in that the execution of the sentence was not suspended at this time. It must be said that it is clearly contrary to justice if it is not abrogated.	{'A': 'translation_llama', 'B': 'target', 'C': 'translation_gpt', 'D': 'translation_azure'}

Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed based on Article 396 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In accordance with Article 21 of the Penal Code, 50 days of the total number of days spent in pre-sentencing detention for trial in this instance shall be deducted from the period of imprisonment imposed by the judgment in prior instance. Applying the main clause of Article 181, paragraph (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this court orders the defendant to bear the court costs in this instance. Thus, the court pronounces the judgment as stated in the main text. 	However, according to the results of the fact-finding in this trial, after the original judgment, a settlement was reached with the victim's family, in which a total of 20 million yen was paid from voluntary insurance, etc., and as a result of the settlement, the victim's family's feelings of resentment have become even more mitigated, and a petition has been made to hope for a lenient disposition, and in light of these circumstances, the sentence of the original judgment is, at this point in time, clearly contrary to justice if it is not overturned in that it did not suspend the execution of the punishment.	{'A': 'translation_azure', 'B': 'translation_gpt', 'C': 'target', 'D': 'translation_llama'}
