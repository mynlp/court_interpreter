In essence, the argument is that since the defendant had no awareness that the goods imported in this case were stimulants, the original judgment that found the defendant guilty of importing stimulants, assuming that the defendant had such awareness, contained a mistaken recognition of a fact that obviously influenced the verdict.	The argument, in essence, is that since the defendant did not have awareness that the items involved in this importation case were stimulants, the original ruling, which recognized the offense of stimulant importation based on the defendant's awareness, contains a clear factual error that affects the judgment.	The essence of the Statement of Reasons for Appeal is as follows: The judgment in prior instance found the defendant guilty of the import of a stimulant drug. It found that he/she had the knowledge that the material imported in this case was a stimulant drug. However, since he/she did not have such knowledge, the judgment has an error in its fact finding which apparently affected the judgment. 	{'A': 'translation_azure', 'B': 'translation_llama', 'C': 'translation_gpt', 'D': 'target'}

However, based on the evidence presented in the original judgment, it is acknowledged that the defendant, having worked as a crew member on the cargo ship ○○ for approximately 20 round trips between Japan and ○○, had knowledge of the prohibition on smuggling narcotics and other substances, as well as relevant customs regulations, gained through their education and training as a crew member in ○○, and it can be inferred that they were aware of the general nature of the stimulant drugs.

Furthermore, it is recognized that, during the defendant's training as a crew member in ○○ country, they acquired knowledge that the smuggling of stimulants and the like is prohibited, as well as understanding of customs-related laws and regulations. Therefore, it is inferred that the defendant was generally aware of what kind of substance stimulants are.	{'A': 'target', 'B': 'translation_azure', 'C': 'translation_llama', 'D': 'translation_gpt'}
handbook-301	而且，以此为前提，在委托搬运本案物品时，甲对被告人所作的，关于物品的搬运及交接方法的指示内容带有极高的隐蔽性，被告人已确认本案物品为装在5只塑料袋里的，白色的晶体性物质，搬入的手段，方法为夹带兴奋剂时常见的，典型的隐藏搬运方法，以及案发前后湮灭证据的行为，被告人对搜查官所作的供词等记录，并综合此认定的各项情节，被告人所作的，关于不知本案物品为兴奋剂的辩解并不足以置信，可以认定被告人在进行本次进口时，已认识到本案物品为兴奋剂。	Taking into account the instructions for the transportation and delivery of the object in question, which were extremely secretive when the defendant was entrusted with the transportation of the object by party A, the fact that the defendant confirmed that the object in question was a white crystalline substance divided into five vinyl bags, the fact that the method of transportation was typical of the method used to smuggle stimulants, and other circumstances such as the destruction of evidence before and after the incident and the content of the defendant's statements to the investigator, the defendant's explanation that he did not know the object in question was a stimulant is not credible at all, and it is reasonable to conclude that the defendant recognized that the object in question was a stimulant at the time of importation.	Based on the following premise: when instructed by Party A to transport the items in question, the instructions regarding the method of transportation or delivery of said items were extremely secretive; the defendant confirmed that the items were a white crystalline substance divided into five plastic bags; the means and method of importation employed a typical concealment transportation method often used for smuggling stimulants and the like; other circumstances evidenced by records such as concealment efforts around the time of the discovery of the case and the contents of the defendant's statements to investigators—taken together, the defendant's explanation that they did not know the items were stimulants is hardly credible. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the defendant was aware that the items in question were stimulants at the time of importation.	Based on this assumption, the defendant's explanation that he/she did not know that the substance in question was a stimulant drug is not reliable at all in light of the following: First, at the time that the defendant was requested by A to carry the material in question, the directions given as to how to transport and deliver it had all the indications of secrecy. Second, the defendant found that the material in question was a white crystalline substance divided into five (5) vinyl bags. Third, the manner in which the material was carried into Japan is a typical undercover method common to transporting stimulant drugs and other drugs. Fourth, there are additional factors shown in the record such as attempts by the defendant to destroy the evidence before and after this case came to light and the statements given by the defendant to investigators. Therefore, it is appropriate to find that the defendant had knowledge at the time of the import in question that the substance in question was a stimulant drug. 	Based on this premise, the defendant confirmed that the instructions on how to transport or deliver the goods when requested by the First Party were extremely confidential, that the accused confirmed that the goods were a white crystalline substance divided into five plastic bags, and that the means of delivery, Considering the fact that the method adopted the typical concealment and transportation method that is often used when bringing in methamphetamine, etc., and other circumstances recognized by the record, such as the destruction of evidence before and after the discovery of this case, and the contents of the accused's statement to the investigating officer, the defendant's excuse that he did not know that the goods in question were methamphetamine is not credible at all. It is reasonable to admit that the accused was aware that the article in question was a methamphetamine.	{'A': 'translation_llama', 'B': 'translation_gpt', 'C': 'target', 'D': 'translation_azure'}
handbook-302	因此，原判综合其例示的各项证据所认定的，原判所示事实是恰当的，并无事实的误认，(控诉的)论述宗旨是没有理由的。	Therefore, it is reasonable for the original judgment to have determined the original facts as they are, by integrating all the evidence presented, and there is no factual error in the original judgment, so the argument is unjustified.	Therefore, it is appropriate that the original judgment recognized the facts as stated by comprehensively considering each piece of evidence presented. There is no factual error in the original judgment, so the argument lacks merit.	Therefore, this court finds that it was proper that the judgment in prior instance found the facts as cited therein based on the pieces of evidence as listed therein, and that there is no error in fact finding. Thus, there is no ground for appeal. 	Therefore, it is reasonable that the original judgment found the facts of the original trial by combining each of the evidences presented, and since there is no factual error in the original judgment, the argument is without merit.	{'A': 'translation_llama', 'B': 'translation_gpt', 'C': 'target', 'D': 'translation_azure'}
handbook-303	(控诉的)论述中心内容为原判的量刑即判处被告人禁锢1年零6个月过重失当。	The argument presented in this appeal in brief claims that the sentence given by the court of prior instance, one year and six months imprisonment without work, is improper in its severity. 	The argument is, in short, that the sentencing of the original judgment that sentenced the defendant to one year and six months in prison was too heavy and unjust.	In short, the appeal argues that the original sentence of one year and six months imprisonment imposed on the defendant was too severe and unjust.	The argument is essentially that the sentence of one year and six months of imprisonment given to the defendant in the original ruling is excessively severe and therefore unjust.	{'A': 'target', 'B': 'translation_azure', 'C': 'translation_llama', 'D': 'translation_gpt'}
handbook-304	根据记录，本案事故是由于被告人的过失造成的，即被告人在始动汽车时只注意到前方汽车的行驶，却没有确认左方的安全，使自己的车与骑着自行车正在横穿人行道中的受害人相撞而使其颠倒并死亡。对照(被告人的)过失及结果的重大性，即使充分考虑控诉论述所指出的对被告人有利的情节，仍可认定原判的量刑在其宣告时是恰当的。	According to the record, the accident in question occurred due to the defendant's negligence in proceeding without checking the safety on the left side after assuming the vehicle in front had started moving. As a result, the defendant's vehicle collided with and knocked down the victim, who was riding a bicycle on the pedestrian crossing, leading to the victim's death. Considering the negligence and the severity of the outcome, even after fully taking into account the favorable circumstances for the defendant pointed out in the argument, it can be recognized that the sentence in the original judgment was appropriate at the time it was pronounced.	According to the record, the accident in this case was as follows: the defendant, while driving an automobile, hit, knocked down and caused the death of the victim who was riding a bicycle in a crosswalk, due to the defendant' s negligence in that he/she started his/her automobile and proceeded just following the start of the preceding vehicle, without confirming safety on the left. Reflecting upon the seriousness of both the negligence and the result of the accident, and even duly considering the circumstances that have been presented in favor of the defendant, sentencing of the judgment in prior instance as handed down at the time should be recognized as proper.	According to the record, the accident in this case was caused by the defendant's negligence in starting the car in front of him without checking the safety of the left side, causing the victim who was riding a bicycle on the pedestrian crossing to collide with his car and cause him to die. It can be admitted that it was reasonable at the time of the sentence.	According to the record, the accident in question occurred due to the defendant's negligence in proceeding with the start without confirming the safety on the left side, conceding to the departure of the preceding vehicle, thereby colliding and knocking down the victim who was proceeding on a crosswalk on a bicycle, resulting in death, and in light of the negligence and severity of the consequences, even considering the favorable circumstances pointed out by the defense's argument, the original judgment's sentencing was deemed reasonable at the time of its pronouncement.	{'A': 'translation_gpt', 'B': 'target', 'C': 'translation_azure', 'D': 'translation_llama'}
handbook-305	但是，根据本次审理调查事实的结果，原判后，(被告人)与受害人的遗属之间已达成从任意保险中...追加支付共计2000万日元的协议，受害感情由于该协议的达成而得以进一步的缓解。考虑到上述情节，在现阶段不得不说原判的量刑没有作出缓刑的决定过重失当，如果不予撤销是违反正义的。	However, according to the results of the fact-finding investigation in the current trial, after the original verdict, a settlement was reached with the victim's bereaved family to pay a total of 20 million yen, including from voluntary insurance and others. Along with the establishment of this settlement, the feelings of the bereaved have further softened, and a petition has been submitted by them requesting leniency in the disposition. Considering these circumstances, it is recognized that the sentence in the original verdict is excessively harsh in that it did not allow for a suspension of execution at this point in time, and it must be said that failing to overturn it would clearly be contrary to justice.	However, according to the results of the examination of the facts by this court, the court finds that after the judgment in prior instance, a settlement was made between the victim's family and the side of the defendant and the insurance, etc. to pay a total of 20 million yen, and as the feelings of the victim's family concerning the accident were mitigated by the settlement, the victim's family hoped in writing that the court grant leniency. In recognition of these circumstances, the sentencing of the judgment in prior instance should be considered too severe, at the present time, on the point that the judgment in prior instance did not grant suspension of the execution of the sentence. It would be clearly unjust if this court did not order a reversal on that point. 	However, as a result of the fact-finding investigation in this trial, it has been revealed that, after the original judgment, a settlement was reached with the victim's family, under which an additional payment of 20 million yen was made from voluntary insurance, and as a result of the settlement, the victim's family's feelings of resentment towards the defendant have subsided, and the family has even petitioned for a lenient disposition, and in light of these circumstances, the sentence imposed by the original judgment, in not suspending the execution of the sentence at this point in time, is clearly excessive and would be a clear injustice if it were not overturned.	However, according to the results of the investigation into the facts of this trial, after the original judgment, there was a dispute with the victim's family and from voluntary insurance. Based on the fact that a settlement was reached by paying a total of 20 million yen, and that the victim's feelings were further alleviated by the conclusion of the settlement, and that the victim's family had made an appeal for leniency, the sentencing of the original judgment was weighted in that the execution of the sentence was not suspended at this time. It must be said that it is clearly contrary to justice if it is not abrogated.	{'A': 'translation_gpt', 'B': 'target', 'C': 'translation_llama', 'D': 'translation_azure'}
